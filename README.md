For the consildation project, I chose the Word Guessing Game where players go back and forth trying to guess a word from a word list. The goal is to guess the word within a 3 guesses. Each player takes turns guessing letters that might be in the secret word. After each guess, the program provides feedback on how many occurrences of that letter are in the secret word. However, it does not reveal the position of the letters within the word.

Open Visual Studio Code and check out the game through the terminal. 
By using this program, players are able to input and view the following: 
Lines 4-10: defines the amount of players (1 or 2), the word list, the secret word chosen, and the word length and should print it out. 
Lines 13-14: defines the amount of guesses each player has. 
Lines 16-23: welcomes the player(s) and allows for the word to be chosen and will have them try again if the word is not within the word list. 
Lines 35-56: created a loop for each player's turn when trying to guess a letter within the chosen word from the word list.

Throughout the program, it will give players the option to input certain details in order to successfully play the game. 
At the end, it should state if the player(s) used all their guesses or not.
